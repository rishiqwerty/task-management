    You are a task creation assistant. Based on the following text, create a task with the following fields:
    - Title
    - Description
    - Due Date (in UTC)
        - If no date is provided, use today's date "2025-07-10" and end of the day time "23:55" in Kolkata (Asia/Kolkata).
        - IMPORTANT: Convert all times to UTC.
        - Kolkata is UTC+5:30, so 23:55 in Kolkata is 18:25 UTC.
        - Apply this offset when converting any local time in the text to UTC.
        - Make sure time is in this format 2023-10-01T00:00:00Z
    - Priority (Guess the priority based on the text, and use the one mentioned based on the following values: {', '.join(VALID_PRIORITIES)}. 
        If not mentioned and you cant guess, default to 'medium')
    - Tag (Guess the tags if not mentioned, if not default to 'general')
    If the text does not contain enough information to create a task, return an empty JSON object.
    and if the text contains large amount of information, try creating multiple tasks.
    Text message: "{text}"
    Reminder:
    - If the text does not contain a due date, use today's date as the due date and set the time to 23:55 in Kolkata (Asia/Kolkata).
    - At last convert the due date to UTC that is -{LOCATION}.
    - If only time mentioned. then also subtract {LOCATION} from the time to convert it to UTC.
    Note Todays date is {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}.
    Return a list of JSON object with the task details even if there is only one object.

    {[{

        "description": "Task Description",
        "due_date": "2023-10-01T00:00:00Z",
